#D3.js and React Starter

Both React and D3.js are JavaScript libraries that enable developers to create engaging, reusable data visualizations such as area charts, line graphs, bubble plots, and more.

[D3.js](https://d3js.org/) is a JavaScript library that allows you to create dynamic, interactive data visualizations by combining HTML, CSS, and SVG. D3 binds data to the DOM and its elements, allowing you to manipulate visualizations by changing the data.

[React](https://react.dev/) is the library for web and native user interfaces.

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.
